# bikesharing

#### Overview:
- The purpose of this project was to create data visualizations that convinces investors that a bike sharing program is a good business proposal.

#### Results:
To solidify the analysis, five visualizations were made to help support why a bike-sharinng in Des Moines would be a great business proposal.
- First looking into the checkout times for users visualization, we can see which times throughout the day were more prown to checkouts by creating a line chart.
###### Checkout times (Tripduration)

- Second, breaking the analysis down by Gender to see if there was a demogrphic that frequent bike-sharing more than the other.

- Thirdly, using heatmaps to see which weekdays were more popular for bike trips and which specific times for users.
###### Trips by weekday for each hour

- To break this analysis down a bit further, we looked into which gender were more prone to for bike trips.
###### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

- Lastly, we created another heatmap that visualized which specific gender took trips during a given day and which times were more popular.
###### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

###### August Hours
- The bar graph in the modules shows the top riding hours in NYC for August are between 5p.m. to 7p.m.

###### Tourist Hotspots
- The dots represent the number of tourists' start locations in NYC. The darker dots indicate that more tourists started their trips in that specific location.

#### Summary:
- Based off the results, we can see that within the first few hours that roughly 146,000 bikeshare users' trips have a duration of around six minutes. To break this observation down a bit further, male users appear to be the group that has the highest trip duration.
- Next is finding the results of days of the week that had the most trips and which hour of the day were most popular. Looking at the visualization for Trips by Weekday for each hour, Tuesday's and Thursdays' from 5p.m.-6p.m were the most popular for bike trips. Males were the group that were more likely to take bike trips at that specific time, around 30,000 males took bike trips around those specific times.
- Lastly, the results indicated that Thurday's and Friday's were popular days for male subscribers to take bike trips.
- After conducting this analysis and reviewing the visualizations made, there are a few things to suggest in order to help improve this business proposal. Firstly, I would suggest making a bar chart visualization that shows the gender/usertype of the customer and subscriber to help simplify the data so it's easier to translate the data.

- The second visualization suggestion would be to make a packed bubble chart to show which demographic uses the bikeshare service the most and which uses it the least. This could be visually easier to see rather than using a heatmap.
